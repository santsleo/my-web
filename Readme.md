# Welcome to my personal website's repo!
I created this simple website as a personal landing page (https://santiagoleoni.com/). To build it I used a bunch of great free resources:
- The Aerial template by AJ (Twitter: @ajlkn). Provided under the CCA 3.0 license (https://html5up.net/).
- The cool background is the particles.js javascript library by Vincent Garreau. Provided under the MIT License (MIT). (https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/)
- The icons are from Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/).
- The favicons were generated using Favicon.io (https://favicon.io/).
- And the font used is 'Shadows Into Light Two' by Kimberly Geswein (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shadows+Into+Light+Two).

I would happily accept any feedback/comments! (You can find contact info on my web :grin:)
