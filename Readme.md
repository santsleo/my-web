# Welcome to my personal website's (santiagoleoni.com) repo!
I created this website as a personal landing page to forward visitors to my other networks or to get my contact info. To build it I used a couple of great free resources:
- The template is called Aerial from html5up.net. It was created by AJ (Twitter: @ajlkn). And it's free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license).
- The cool background is the particles.js javascript library. Freely provided by Vincent Garreau under the MIT License (MIT). (https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/)
- The icons are provided by Font Awesome (fontawesome.io).
- The favicons were generated using (https://favicon.io/).
- And the font used is Shadows Into Light Two by Kimberly Geswein (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shadows+Into+Light+Two).

I would happily accept any feedback/comments! (You can find connact info on my web :grin:)
